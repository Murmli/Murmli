# Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: App does not load or shows a blank screen while compiling

When compiling in VSCode, you might encounter an issue where the screen remains blank, and the deployment process does not complete. This is often due to Live Reload issues or deployment inconsistencies.

### Solution 1: Adjust Live Reload settings in VSCode

1. **Turn off Live Reload in VSCode** (or, if it is disabled, enable it and then disable it again). This sometimes resolves deployment and blank screen issues.
2. **Retry the deployment** with the following command:

   ```bash
   npx npm run ionic:build && npx cap copy && npx cap run android --target=Pixel_8_API_35 --no-sync
   ```

   - **Explanation**:
     - `npx npm run ionic:build`: Builds the Ionic project.
     - `npx cap copy`: Copies the web assets to the native platform (Android in this case).
     - `npx cap run android --target=Pixel_8_API_35 --no-sync`: Runs the app on the specified Android target (replace with your actual target if different), without syncing the live reload.

### Solution 2: Rebuild and Restart the Project

If the issue persists, try rebuilding the project by cleaning the build directory and re-running the commands from Solution 1.
